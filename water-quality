# Water Quality

## What Happens Upstream Matters!
Water alone is not enough; quality matters too. Quality is not only important for human uses such as drinking water and swimming, but also for the flora and fauna that call those waters home. They, too, need clean water to survive.

### Water Quality Effects
Although transparent, water isnâ€™t always clean! As water moves throughout an ecosystem, it can become exposed to different substances that can alter the quality of water. When water quality is degraded, it can cause things like:
<ul>
  <li>
    Closures due to harmful algal blooms
  </li>
  <li>
    Fish consumption advisories
  </li>
   <li>
    Swimming restrictions due to pathogens
 </li>
  <li>
    Expensive treatment to meet drinking standards
 </li>
 </ul>
 
### Impairments
Some substances in the water column occur naturally. Water sources can pick up nutrients from decaying matter, or carry certain minerals from rock that waters interact with. But some substances occur unnaturally, or can be exacerbated by human influence. For example, too much nutrients in the water column from fertilizer use can cause algal blooms. Pharmaceuticals can enter our waterways from the flushing or improper disposal of medication.

#### Possible impairments in water are:
<ul>
  <li>
Excess nutrients, from use of fertilizer
</li>
<li>
Heavy metals, like mercury
</li>
<li>
Pathogens
</li>
<li>
Sediment
</li>
<li>
Rising water temperatures, due to changing climate
</li>
<li>
Newly emerging contaminants, like Micro-plastic
</li>
</ul>
