      <p>Water occurs in many forms; precipitation (rain, fog and snow), streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, snow pack, permafrost,       glaciers, soil water (moisture), and groundwater. 
       This is water that can be seen on the surface such as rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, glaciers or wetlands. 
      Surface water interacts with many different factors in the environment and as such can become contaminated 
        or pick up different pollutants along the way.</p>

  <h4>Ancestral Pueblo People of Mesa Verde:</h4>
    <p>About 1,400 years ago, long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. For more than 700 years they and their descendants lived and flourished here, eventually building elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls. </p>
