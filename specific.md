       How Much Water is Found in NPS Units?
       Over 150,000 miles of rivers and streams flow through national parks and over 4 million acres of water bodies like          lakes, reservoirs, and oceans can be found within park boundaries. 
      However, ensuring an ample supply of water for all uses can be a challenge for state and federal agencies.

      <p>During prolonged periods of high temperatures and low precipitation, evaporation from reservoirs can substantially lower water levels. </p>
  <p>For example, Lake Mead National Recreation Area surrounds a large reservoir on the Colorado River that stores water for irrigation, hydropower and municipal water delivery uses. Over the years, Lake Mead has lost a significant amount of water due to drought and a warming climate. Measuring water levels helps us determine trends that can affect parks over time. Scientists predict that current use coupled with a dryer climate could cause the lake to potentially lose up to 12 vertical feet of water annually! Although many parks do not control the operation of dams, they can adjust the management techniques of water-based recreational activities ( like boating and fishing) for parks based on water availability.</p>
