    <h4>Surface Water:</h4>
      <p>Water occurs in many forms; precipitation (rain, fog and snow), streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, snow pack, permafrost,       glaciers, soil water (moisture), and groundwater. 
       This is water that can be seen on the surface such as rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, glaciers or wetlands. 
      Surface water interacts with many different factors in the environment and as such can become contaminated 
        or pick up different pollutants along the way.</p>

  <h4>Groundwater:</h4>
    <p>Groundwater is water underneath the earth's surface that fills the cracks and voids that occur in the soil and bedrock. 
        Groundwater supplies springs and provides base flow to rivers and streams as well as supporting wetlands. 
      It is especially important in the west where water is scarce. </p>

  <h4>Hydrology:</h4>
  <p>In short, hydrology is the study of the occurrence and movement of water in the environment. Water comes in many forms     and frequently changes and moves throughout the environment. As water interacts with its surroundings, it can affect            habitats and resources in different ways.</p>
