    The Chihuahuan Desert Network (CHDN) is one of 32 National Park Service inventory and monitoring networks implementing Vital Signs monitoring to assess the condition of park ecosystems and develop a strong scientific basis for stewardship and management of natural resources across the National Park System. The CHDN is currently developing protocols to monitor several vital signs that may reflect current and future impacts of climate change. This brief offers a summary of how CHDN monitoring will detect future change.
             Water and water-dependent ecosystems are scarce resources in the arid southwest, and are generally rgarded as biodiversity hotspots. Seeps and springs are critical surface water sources and are among the most restricted habitats for plant and animal species. Precipitation is critical to the existence of seeps and springs. The size, frequency, and duration of precipitation events are key factors influencing spring-water availability. Climate change is expected to alter surface water quantity, as well as seasonal patterns of flooding and drought, and springs will be a direct indicator of these changes. 
             The CHDN will monitor discharge, water quality, macroinvertebrates, and vegetation at a subset ofsprings in the network.
